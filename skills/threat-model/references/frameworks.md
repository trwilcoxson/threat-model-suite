## Threat Actor Profiles

Reference profiles for common threat actors. Phase 1 selects relevant actors based on system characteristics.

| Actor Type | Motivation | Typical Access | Common Techniques |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Nation-State / APT** | Espionage, disruption, strategic advantage | Any — can achieve all access levels | Zero-days, supply chain compromise, long-term persistent access, custom malware, social engineering at scale |
| **Organized Crime** | Financial gain | External; may purchase insider access | Ransomware, credential stuffing, BEC, payment fraud, exploit kits |
| **Hacktivist** | Ideology, publicity, disruption | External | DDoS, defacement, data leaks for embarrassment, social engineering |
| **Malicious Insider** | Revenge, financial gain, ideology | Privileged internal | Data exfiltration, sabotage, privilege abuse, unauthorized access |
| **Negligent Insider** | Unintentional | Legitimate internal | Misconfiguration, phishing victim, credential sharing, shadow IT, accidental data exposure |
| **Opportunistic / Script Kiddie** | Curiosity, notoriety, low-effort gain | External unauthenticated | Automated scanners, known exploits, default credentials, exposed services |
| **Competitor** | Commercial advantage, espionage | External; may use social engineering | Scraping, reverse engineering, trade secret theft, employee poaching |
| **Supply Chain Attacker** | Varies (often nation-state or organized crime proxy) | Indirect — through trusted dependencies | Compromised packages, malicious updates, build pipeline injection, typosquatting |

Assign capability 1-5 based on system context.

### Actor Selection Criteria

Select actors based on the system's data sensitivity, exposure model, and industry. Include both external and internal threat categories.

---

## STRIDE-LM

STRIDE-LM extends the classic STRIDE model with Lateral Movement. Assess each category against every component and data flow.

### Spoofing (Identity)
Can an attacker impersonate a legitimate entity — user, service, or data source?

### Tampering (Integrity)
Can data be modified without detection — in transit, at rest, in processing, or in configuration?

### Repudiation (Accountability)
Can actions be performed without attribution or forensic traceability?

### Information Disclosure (Confidentiality)
Can sensitive data leak to unauthorized parties via errors, logs, side channels, storage, transit, or access control gaps?

### Denial of Service (Availability)
Can availability be disrupted through resource exhaustion, dependency failures, state corruption, or amplification?

### Elevation of Privilege (Authorization)
Can an attacker gain unauthorized access levels through vertical/horizontal escalation, injection, or misconfiguration?

### LM — Lateral Movement
Can an attacker pivot from this component to other parts of the system through network access, credential reuse, trust exploitation, or container/host escape?

---

## AI/ML Security Threats (Supplementary)

Assess these when the system includes AI/ML components, **in addition to** STRIDE-LM.

### A. LLM Application Threats
- Prompt injection (direct)
- Prompt injection (indirect)
- Data poisoning / training data integrity
- Model extraction / model inversion
- Adversarial inputs / safety filter bypass
- Information leakage (training data, system prompts, context)

### B. Agentic AI Threats
- Tool-call injection
- Agent-to-agent trust chain compromise
- Delegation escalation
- Autonomous action with insufficient human-in-the-loop
- Agent memory/state poisoning
- Excessive agency (over-permissioned tools)
- Confused deputy via tool results

### C. RAG-Specific Threats
- Retrieval poisoning
- Embedding space manipulation
- Context window stuffing
- Knowledge base data exfiltration
- Stale/inconsistent retrieval

### D. Multi-Modal Threats
- Image-based prompt injection
- Audio-based injection
- Cross-modal confusion

## OWASP Risk Rating Methodology

The prioritization formula used after STRIDE-LM identification and PASTA attack simulation:

**Risk = Likelihood x Impact**

Both Likelihood and Impact are scored 1-5. The product determines the severity band.

### Likelihood Scoring (1-5)

Likelihood is derived from PASTA attack simulation (Stages 4-5).

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Very Low | Requires nation-state resources, zero-days, physical access, or an implausible chain of preconditions |
| **2** | Low | Requires significant expertise, dedicated effort, and insider knowledge; not automatable |
| **3** | Medium | Achievable with moderate skill and publicly available tools; some preconditions needed |
| **4** | High | Straightforward with common tools and basic technical knowledge; few preconditions |
| **5** | Very High | Trivially exploitable, automatable, no special skills or access needed |

### Impact Scoring (1-5)

Impact is derived from PASTA business impact analysis (Stages 6-7). Assess across four dimensions and take the **highest** as the overall impact score:

| Dimension | Low (1-2) | Medium (3) | High (4-5) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Financial** | Minimal direct cost | Significant but contained loss | Major loss or existential threat |
| **Operational** | No or brief disruption | Partial outage, hours to recover | Major or complete outage, days+ to recover |
| **Reputational** | Internal awareness only | Limited public awareness | Major press coverage or sustained crisis |
| **Regulatory** | No implications or minor gap | Formal finding, corrective action | Investigation, significant fines, or license risk |

Adjust thresholds to the organization's scale.

### Risk Score Matrix

Multiply Likelihood x Impact. Map the product to severity bands:

```
                    IMPACT
              1     2     3     4     5
         +-----------------------------+
    1    |  1     2     3     4     5  |
L   2    |  2     4     6     8    10  |
i   3    |  3     6     9    12    15  |
k   4    |  4     8    12    16    20  |
e   5    |  5    10    15    20    25  |
         +-----------------------------+
```

| Risk Score | Severity | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1-4       | LOW      | Accept or address opportunistically |
| 5-9       | MEDIUM   | Schedule remediation in backlog |
| 10-16     | HIGH     | Plan remediation within current cycle |
| 17-25     | CRITICAL | Immediate remediation required |

## LINDDUN Privacy Threats

Assess each category for data flows and stores handling personal data.

| Category | Definition | Key Questions |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **L**inkability | Can an attacker link two or more items of interest (records, actions, identities)? | Are user actions correlatable across services? Can pseudonymized data be re-identified? |
| **I**dentifiability | Can an attacker identify a data subject from the data? | Is PII minimized? Are identifiers necessary? Can aggregated data identify individuals? |
| **N**on-repudiation | Is the data subject unable to deny involvement? | Are audit trails exposing user behavior unnecessarily? Can users plausibly deny actions? |
| **D**etectability | Can an attacker determine whether a data item about a subject exists? | Do query patterns reveal membership? Can metadata analysis reveal data existence? |
| **D**isclosure | Can an attacker learn the content of a data item? | Is personal data encrypted? Are access controls sufficient? Are there data leak vectors? |
| **U**nawareness | Is the data subject unaware of data collection or processing? | Are privacy notices adequate? Is consent granular? Is data processing transparent? |
| **N**on-compliance | Does the system fail to comply with privacy regulations? | GDPR data subject rights (access, deletion, portability)? CCPA opt-out? HIPAA minimum necessary? Data retention policies? |

## Zero Trust Assessment Criteria

Evaluate whether the architecture follows zero trust principles or relies on perimeter security assumptions.

| Principle | Assessment Questions |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Verify explicitly** | Does every service-to-service call authenticate the caller? Are requests authorized based on identity, not network position? Is authentication performed at every layer, not just the edge? |
| **Least privilege access** | Are permissions scoped to specific resources and actions? Are they time-bound where possible? Are service accounts per-workload with minimal scope? |
| **Assume breach** | Is east-west traffic encrypted and monitored? Can a compromised component be isolated? Is blast radius limited by segmentation? Are secrets rotatable without downtime? |
| **Micro-segmentation** | Are network policies enforced at the workload level (not just subnet)? Can components only reach the specific services they need? Are database connections restricted to authorized services? |
| **Continuous verification** | Are sessions re-validated? Do tokens have reasonable expiry? Is behavior-based anomaly detection in place? Are device/context signals evaluated on each request? |

## PASTA — Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

PASTA is the seven-stage, risk-centric methodology that provides the **attack simulation and business impact data** feeding into the OWASP Risk Rating formula. STRIDE-LM identifies threats; PASTA quantifies their likelihood and impact.

### Seven Stages — Mapped to Skill Phases

| Stage | PASTA Process | Skill Phase | Output |
|-------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **Define Objectives** — Business objectives, compliance requirements, risk appetite | Phase 1 — Reconnaissance | Business context, compliance scope, risk appetite |
| 2 | **Define Technical Scope** — Architecture, technology stack, data flows | Phase 1 — Reconnaissance | Technology inventory, architecture understanding |
| 3 | **Application Decomposition** — DFDs, trust boundaries, entry points | Phase 2 — Diagram | Mermaid DFD with trust boundaries |
| 4 | **Threat Analysis** — Threat intelligence, attack patterns, threat agents | Phase 3 — STRIDE-LM + MITRE | Categorized threat inventory |
| 5 | **Vulnerability Analysis** — Map threats to weaknesses | Phase 3 — CWE + OWASP | Weakness mappings per threat |
| 6 | **Attack Modeling** — Build attack trees, simulate attack paths | Phase 4 — Risk Quantification | Attack feasibility -> **Likelihood score (1-5)** |
| 7 | **Risk & Impact Analysis** — Business impact, risk rating, prioritization | Phase 4 — Risk Quantification | Business impact -> **Impact score (1-5)** |

### Stage 6 — Attack Modeling (produces Likelihood)

For each STRIDE-LM threat, build a concrete attack path:

1. **Entry point**: How does the attacker gain initial access?
2. **Attack steps**: What sequence of actions achieves the objective? What tools or techniques are required at each step?
3. **Preconditions**: What must be true for the attack to succeed (configuration, timing, access level)?
4. **Existing controls**: What security mechanisms must the attacker bypass?
5. **Likelihood assessment**: Given the above, rate likelihood 1-5 (see OWASP Risk Rating section)

### Stage 7 — Risk & Impact Analysis (produces Impact)

For each threat with a modeled attack path, assess business impact:

1. **Affected business process**: Which revenue, operational, or compliance processes are disrupted?
2. **Financial impact**: Direct costs (incident response, recovery, legal) + indirect costs (lost revenue, customer churn)
3. **Operational impact**: Duration and severity of disruption, recovery complexity
4. **Reputational impact**: Visibility, customer trust erosion, competitive implications
5. **Regulatory impact**: Notification obligations, potential fines, audit findings, certification risk
6. **Impact assessment**: Rate impact 1-5 using the highest dimension (see OWASP Risk Rating section)

### Completing the Risk Calculation

After PASTA Stages 6-7 produce Likelihood and Impact scores, apply the OWASP Risk Rating formula:

```
Risk Score = Likelihood (1-5) x Impact (1-5)
-> Map to severity band: LOW (1-4) | MEDIUM (5-9) | HIGH (10-16) | CRITICAL (17-25)
```

This produces the prioritized threat list used in the final report.

## Framework ID Verification

**When mapping threats to framework IDs (MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs, CWE IDs), adhere to these rules:**

1. **Only use IDs listed in this reference file.** The MITRE and CWE tables above are the authoritative set for this skill.
2. **If a threat maps to a technique/CWE not in the tables**, describe the threat in plain text and note "No matching ID in reference set — manual verification recommended."
3. **Never fabricate or guess framework IDs.** An incorrect ID is worse than no ID — it creates false confidence and misdirects remediation.
4. **Cross-check before finalizing**: In Phase 6 (False Positive Validation), verify every framework ID in the findings against the tables in this file.
