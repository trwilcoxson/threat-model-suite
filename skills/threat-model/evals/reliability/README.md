# Reliability harness (reference-free, dynamic)

Validates that the threat-model flow is **reliable on whatever you point it at** — not that it
reproduces a fixed answer. There is no per-target ground truth. A target is just a real system
(`targets/<id>.yaml` = id + source + a local repo path supplied at runtime); adding one is adding
a file and cloning a repo. The system is run **N times** per target.

This supersedes the answer-key approach in `../cases/` + `../harness/` (fixed prompts with
hand-authored must-find lists). That approach forced answers — e.g. it recorded a correctly
reasoned MEDIUM(9) finding as a "miss" because the key demanded HIGH. Quality here is graded from
properties of `(target, output)` that hold for any good threat model, so it scales to any target.

## How quality is judged without an answer key

Five layers. The system emits, per run, `report.md` + two manifests (`recon.json`, `findings.json`,
see `schema/`). Everything below is derived from those plus the real repo.

**Deterministic (the reliability contract — should hold on every run, any target):**
1. **Structure** — manifests parse and carry required fields; `report.md` has the template sections.
2. **Consistency** — `severity == band(likelihood × impact)`; `summary_counts` match the findings;
   `TM-NNN` cross-refs and `report.md`↔manifest counts agree; CWE/MITRE ids are well-formed.
3. **Grounding** — every recon element's `evidence` resolves in the actual repo (path/glob/string);
   every finding ref points to a real recon id. Catches invented components.
4. **Coverage** — every entry point / data store / trust boundary the system *itself* discovered is
   addressed by a finding or explicitly marked `no_issue_surface`. The denominator is the system's
   own recon, not a golden list.
5. **Diagram** (`diagram_checks.py`) — the threat-model diagram is the core artifact, so it is
   verified against the skill's own spec: required layers per scaling (L1-L4), every edge typed and
   annotated (protocol / sensitivity / `[ENC|PLAIN]`, spec §4), trust-boundary subgraphs, component
   ownership markers (§7), legend + version stamp (§6), and an L4 risk overlay linked to the findings
   (risk classes + threat annotations whose `TM-NNN` ids match, every HIGH+ finding's components
   present, §5). See [`sample-runs/DIAGRAM-FINDING.md`](sample-runs/DIAGRAM-FINDING.md) — adding this
   caught that all earlier runs produced under-built diagrams while passing every other check.

**Agent-judged (sampled, reference-free):**
5a. **Quality** (`quality-judge`) — is each attack path sound against the real repo, and is severity
    *defensible* (not equal to a target)? Is it proportionate (no padding, no invented components)?
5b. **Adversarial recall** (`red-team` → `gap-validator`) — an independent agent threat-models the
    same repo and surfaces HIGH+ risks the model missed; a second agent confirms each is grounded,
    uncovered, and material. This replaces hand-authored must-finds with gaps generated per target.
5c. **Recon completeness** (`recon-auditor`) — compares recon to the real repo so the coverage
    denominator can't be gamed by a recon that skipped a subsystem.
5d. **Diagram correctness** (`diagram-judge`) — beyond the deterministic presence checks, judges
    whether trust boundaries are placed right, flow annotations are accurate, and the L4 risk layer
    faithfully reflects the findings, against the real architecture.

**Stability:** across the N runs, the HIGH+ "core" is matched semantically and we report how much of
it is present in *every* run. Reliability = the crown jewels appear every time; breadth may vary.

## Run it

```bash
cd skills/threat-model/evals/reliability
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat.git /tmp/nodegoat   # the target
# Run the skill N times on the repo (Executor prompt in prompts/executor.md), each emitting
# report.md + recon.json + findings.json into runs/<target>/run{1..N}/.
# Run the judged layers (quality-judge / red-team -> gap-validator / recon-auditor) into runs/<target>/agents/.
python3 run.py report --runs-root runs/nodegoat --repo /tmp/nodegoat \
    --target nodegoat --source https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat --out runs/nodegoat/reliability.html
```

`run.py check --run <dir> --repo <path>` runs just the deterministic layer on a single run.

Committed real runs are under [`sample-runs/`](sample-runs/): NodeGoat (web app, with a multi-iteration
[improvement loop](sample-runs/nodegoat/improvements/LOOP-CLOSURE.md) — and the
[product-grade visuals verification](sample-runs/nodegoat/improvements/iteration-v5-product-grade/NOTE.md)),
TerraGoat (Terraform IaC), and crAPI (~900-file polyglot microservices + LLM agent) — same harness,
three different system types, no per-target tuning.

## Observability — `tm-observe`

Make the multi-agent run transparent. As personas run they emit a `tm.run-event/1` stream
(`events.ndjson`, a projection of each Execution Log); `tm_observe.py` renders an uncluttered
"what agent is doing what" view — pure function of the stream, same input → byte-identical output.

```bash
python3 run.py observe --transcripts <workflow-transcript-dir> --run <id> [--tree|--once]
python3 tm_observe.py events.ndjson [--tail|--tree|--once]
```

See [`../../references/pipeline-observability.md`](../../references/pipeline-observability.md).

## Coverage ledger (proposed)

`coverage_checks.py` (per [`openspec/changes/add-coverage-ledger`](../../../../openspec/changes/add-coverage-ledger/))
verifies the skill's `coverage.json` ledger structurally: every applicable production-grade taxonomy
item reached a terminal state (`present`/`partial`/`absent`/`not-applicable`/`unknown`), `present`
cites a resolving source, `unknown` carries a note — never requiring a specific item present.

## Design

The whole harness is specified in [`openspec/`](../../../../openspec/) — see its README for the
capability map and the determinism principle.
